    <h1> Why Spider-Man PS4 is the Best Marvel Game to Come Out.</h1>
    
    <h2>ALERT!</h2>
    <p>Before you start reading this Spider-Man PS4 research site, be aware that there will be MAJOR SPOILERS about the story. So if you haven't played or watched a let's play for this game, GO DO EITHER ONE OF THEM. SERIOUSLY. For those you who have done either of the requirements... Welcome, I hope you enjoy the content I have prepared for you "today." </p>
    
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Peter is 23 years old and is still learning how to balance his hero work and his normal life. He has just defeated the “Kingpin” a.k.a Wilson fisk. He volunteers at a homeless shelter named F.E.A.S.T. He works with his Aunt May and their boss, Martin Li. Peter’s actual “normal” job is being a scientist at Octavius Industries led by Otto Octavius. Peter and Mary Jane (MJ) are separate from each other and haven’t talked to each other since. Until MJ was on a secretive mission and almost got caught by Demons. Demons are new type of enemy that Peter has never faced before. But in the process of taking down the Demons and finding their leader, Peter caused the trail of dominos to topple over. The city has faced a bombing by the Demons. Which has caused a group of casualties. (SPOILER ALERT) One of them was officer Jefferson Davis. Who had just received an award for saving Spider-Man’s life and for his service.<a class="trailer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIOTV3AE8hI">(Spoiler)</a> And because of that sacrifice. Peter is determined to find and defeat the leader of the Demons. But even Peter’s spidey sense couldn't detect the real danger that’s imminent.</p>

    <h2>DLC (Downloadable Content)</h2>
    <p>So far there are 2 DLC (downloadable content) out. The first one to come out is “The Heist”,“Turf Wars", and finally "Silver Lining". The series of these packs are called "The City that never Sleeps".<p>
    
    
    <ul>
      <li><a class="trailer" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/24/marvels-spider-man-ps4-the-heist-dlc-review">The Heist</a></li>
    </ul>
      <p>This DLC pack is all about Peter's past. Black Cat a.k.a Felicia Hardy comes back to Manhattan with a new goal. Peter is worried about what happened in the past. Before the game took place. When MJ and Peter first separated, Peter was dating Felicia. And because of that Peter convinced Felicia to work with him to fight crime. But Felicia decided to break up with Peter and quit being the Black Cat to start a new life in a different city. But now she's back with a new plan to manipulate Peter to do her dirty work with the Maggia gang.</p>
    
    <h3>Suits</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Scarlet Spider MK II</li>
      <li>Resilient Suit</li>
      <li>Spider-UK</li>
    </ol>
    
      <h4><a class="trail" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-7BBrWyNpU">Trailer</a></h4>
    
    <ul>
      <li><a class="trailer" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/21/marvels-spider-man-ps4-turf-wars-dlc-review">Turf Wars</a></li>
    </ul>
   <p>This pack is a continuation to "The Heist". It's about Peter fighting off the Maggia family gang. He has to face off against the stongest forehead in New York. No not the Hulk,nor Iron Man, and not Thor. NO not Thanos, he has the stongest chin in the universe. It's <a class="trailer" href="spideyphotomode.html">Hammerhead</a>. His name is Hammerhead because he kills people with his forehead. Why does he have the stongest forehead? When Hammerhead was little he severely damaged his skull. So he got a most of his skull replaced with a metal alloy almost like a metal plate. Hammerhead is the head (with the stongest forehead) of the Maggia (one of New York's crime families). He wants to take over New York. But Spider-Man and NYPD are there to stop him. But the captain of NYPD, Yuri Watanabe, has a personal issue with Hammerhead. So far the only the story gives us is that Hammerhead made it personal a long time ago and killed many of Yuri's men. Not only that but he got his hands on Sable International technology. Which is like the government of the this Earth. But Peter and the officers took Hammerhead down or so it would seem.</p>
    
    <h3>Suits</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Classic Iron Spider</li>
      <li>Spider-Clan</li>
      <li>Spider-Armor MK I</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4><a class="trail" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpLArXlzEb8">Trailer</a></h4>
    
    <ul>
      <li><a class="trailer" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/22/marvels-spider-man-ps4-silver-lining-dlc-review">Sliver Lining</a></li></ul>
      
      <p> So this DLC pack is a continuation to the "Turf Wars" pack. Last time we met Hammerhead he was in a body bag headed to the morgue/prison. But one of his men has resurrected him him and broke him out. Now he has come back bigger and stronger. Peter needs help from a old "friend" to defeat the big bad. That "friend" is Sliver Sable. I say "friend" with quotations because Sable has weird relationship with Spidey. She neither hates nor likes him. But with the help of Peter's charm, he wins her over to liking him as a partner. Last time we saw Sable, she was off to Symkaria to fight the country's civil war. She came back not to help Spidey but to gain her weapons back from the Maggia crime family/Hammerhead. But in the process, she decided to help Spidey to defeat Hammerhead. And with help of Sable, Peter finally put Hammerhead down in prison without killing him. Also in this pack, it shows the path <a class="trailer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ4oF9GIGbA">Miles</a> is pursuing to become Peter's successor A.K.A the "Ultimate Spider-Man".</p>

    <h2>Wait There's More!!</h2>
    <p>Yes there's more to the game! When your playing through the story you unlock side missions. Some of them include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spider-Men</li>
      <li>Tombstone Story Line</li>
      <li>The Network is Down</li>
      <li>Storming the Castle</li>
      <li>Helping Howard (Collect Pigeons)</li>
      <li>Spider-Man P.I</li>
      <li>Internet Famous</li>
      <li>College Buddies</li>
      <li>Tick Tock</li>
      <li>Over his Head</li>
      <li>A Matter of Debate</li>
      <li>Home Team Advantage</li>
      <li>Snipe Hunt</li>
      <li>Error:File Not Found</li>
      <li>Fisk Hideouts</li>
      <li>Demon Warehouses</li>
      <li>Prisoner Camps</li>
      <li>Sable Outposts</li>
      <li>Secret Photo Ops (Required to get ESU Suit)</li>
      <li>Landmark Photo Ops</li>
      <li>Old High School Backpacks</li>
      <li>Black Cat Stakeouts (Required to get Dark Suit)</li>
      <li>Taskmaster series</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With the Taskmaster series, who have to finish a specific amount of Taskmaster challenges to fight you. Tomb Stone is a tall and rock like human being. When he was a kid he was exposed to a chemical that made him like a rock consistency. Then there are also many and I mean MANY crimes that can occur in the city. Which you have a complete a certain amount of each crime to get 100% completion</p>
    
    <h3>DLC Side Mission</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Like a Fiddle (Collect Original Black Cat Stolen Art)</li>
        <li>Hammerhead Fronts</li>
        <li>Olympus Hideouts</li>
        <li>Aiding a Human</li>
        <li>Scales of Justice</li>
        <li>Screwball Challenges</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now the Screwball challenges are very identical to the Taskmaster challenges, but instead of analyzing Spider-Man's abilities, Screwball makes the player do these challenges for subcribers and content for her Youtube channel. To most players it will be very annoying, but it will be worth it in the end. (at least in the "Silver Lining" story pack)</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Photo Mode</h2>
    <p>Yes. There is a photo mode in this game. And with the photo mode you can create funny and cool looking photos. It has an indepth interface allowing the player to include stickers in their photos and modify the camera settings (i.e. FOV, Field of Depth, etc.) Here are some of mine mine:</p>
        <h4 class="pic"><a class="trail" href="spidey_photos.html">Photo Mode Pictures</a></h4>
    
    <h2>Web-Swinging</h2>
    <p>Now this game has brought back a mechanic which has never been used except for "Spider-Man 2." This mechanic is ... PHYSICS!!! This mechanic allows the webs to actually stick to objects. So when you web-swing through the city, you can see that the web strand actually stuck to the building. This is so GAME CHANGING (get it because this is about a game okay I'll show myself out). I know that was a really bad joke but physics change the way this game is played. In other Spider-Man games, the webs usually stick to the sky. Which isn't really realistic. But this mechanic makes it so that you (the player) can't swing above the Empire State Building and makes them actually feel like Spider-Man. Physics make Peter the "friendly neighborhood Spider-Man" he truly is.</p>

    <h2>Insomniac Games</h2>
    <p> The developer of this game is Insomniac Games. They are the guys that created the great Ratchet and Clank. They primarily got chosen to create Spider-Man because they created a type of physics that are similar to the on in the original Spider-Man 2. They first started to play around with physics when they created their hit "Sunset Overdrive." Which is really loved for the physics. This is not related but they also made the original Spyro the Dragon game.</p>
